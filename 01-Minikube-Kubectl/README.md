# 🎯 Goal

In this challenge, we will learn how to deploy our first application with **Kubernetes** and **Minikube** by putting a FastAPI endpoint onto a cluster. 🚀

Minikube allows developers to run Kubernetes **locally** on their machine, as though it was a cluster of nodes. It is an excellent tool to **help developers and new Kubernetes users in deploying applications with K8s**.

Under the hood, Minikube creates a virtual machine in a container with a single cluster of one node.

To use Minikube, as detailed in the documentation at [this link](<https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>), we'll need:

- **2 CPUs** or more
- **2GB of RAM**
- **20GB** of free disk space
- **Container or virtual machine manager** such as: Docker, Hyperkit, Podman, etc.

In our case, we will use Docker to launch Minikube.

# Installation

First check your available disk space (`df -h`) and free up space if needed:
- Remove unused Docker containers and images:
  ```bash
  docker stop $(docker ps -q)
  docker system prune
  ```
- Remove unused `.venv`s: from the root of your challenges folder: `rm -rf **/.venv`.

# 0️⃣ First, some theory

📚 Take 5 min to read [this amazing summary article 📚](https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-101-pods-nodes-containers-and-clusters-c1509e409e16) that complement this morning's lecture.

<br>

# 1️⃣ K8s Power User Setup 🎁

### K8's terminal auto-completion

Add the two following lines at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file then reopen a new terminal

```bash
[[ $commands[kubectl] ]] && source <(kubectl completion zsh)
[[ $commands[minikube] ]] && source <(minikube completion zsh)
```

If you type `minikube <TAB>` or `kubectl <TAB>` it should give you a list of commands! In the terminal, the **tab** key is your best friend!

### VScode Extensions

Before you get started there are some key extensions we need for VSCode to make developing k8s a breeze. Make sure you have Kubernetes, Kubernetes templates, and YAML - all highlighted in the image below 👇.

# 2️⃣ Launching Minikube 🚀

To launch Minikube and start a cluster, you'll need to open a terminal and run the following command :

```bash
minikube start
```

Wait Minikube to start, it can take up to a few minutes.

Once started, you can interact with your cluster thanks to `kubectl`, just like for for any other K8s cluster.

For instance, you can inspect your cluster node.

```bash
kubectl get node
```

You should see something like:

```bash
NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane,master   75s   v1.23.3
```

<br>

# 3️⃣ Sharing your Docker daemon 🐳

When you work with Minikube, you work within a VM with its own docker daemon.

In order to let our local Docker daemon to communicate with Minikube's Docker daemon, we need to specifies to the Docker client to use the Docker service running inside the Minikube virtual machine.

❓ Run the following command **and follow its instructions**:

```bash
minikube docker-env
```

Now any `docker` command you run in this current terminal will run against the Docker inside Minikube cluster. Check it out with `docker ps`, you should see a dozen of `k8s_...` containers names running! (careful, your VS code docker-extension is not connected to this new context 😢)


❓ Now `build` the Dockerfile against the docker inside Minikube, which is instantly accessible to Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
docker build -t app .
```

💡 Alternatively, there is one other effective way to push your local Docker image directly to Minikube, which could save time from building the images in Minikube again: `minikube image load <image_name>`

<br>

# 4️⃣ Our first K8s Service 🗄️

Let's create our first service on Kubernetes. A service is
- an **abstraction** that defines a set of **Pods** running in your cluster
- and a **policy** by which to reach them.

Sometimes this pattern is called a [**micro-service**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).

<img src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/W1D5/load-balancer.png" width=600>

When created, the Service is assigned a unique IP address.
This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive.

Pods can be configured to talk to the Service, and know that communication to the Service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is part of the Service.

These Pods are exposed through endpoints. When a Pod dies, it is automatically removed from the endpoints, and new Pods matching the Service's selector will automatically get added to the endpoints.

❓ Create a configuration file for our service - `service.yaml` - and copy below content into it.

```yaml
#service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: fastapi-service

spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      name: service-port
      targetPort: 8000 # MUST be the port exposed by FastAPI "CMD" in DockerFile
      port: 5000 # Choose what you want here
  selector:
    app: fastapi

```

In the first part, we specify that the configuration file is for a Service that we named `fastapi-service`.

A selector usually determines the set of Pods targeted by a Service.
In the spec, we specify `fastapi-service` is a **LoadBalancer service**.

This specification creates a new Service object named "fastapi-service". But how are the ports working?

- `targetPort` 8000: The port of the pods (where the fastAPI is running).
- `port` 5000: The exposed port external users use to access the Service

Finally apply the `service.yaml` config file to create the service 👇

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

You should see `service/fastapi-service created`

Let's inspect our new service

```bash
kubectl get service fastapi-service
```

You should see something like this (don't worry about IP for now)

```bash
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
fastapi-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.231.152   <pending>     5000:30604/TCP   24s
```

# 5️⃣ Add the Deployment 🛰

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*iTAVk3glVD95hb-X3HiCKg.webp" width=500>

Within Kubernetes, a container runs in a pod, which can be represented as **one instance of a running service**.

Pods are ephemeral and not self-healing, which makes them fragile. 🤕

They can go down when an interruption occurs on the server, during a brief network problem, or due to a minimal memory issue — and it can bring down your entire application with it. Kubernetes deployments help to prevent this downtime. 💪

In a deployment, you can describe the desired state for your application and Kubernetes will constantly check if this state is matched.

A deployment will create `ReplicaSets` which then ensures that the desired number of pods are running. If a pod goes down due to an interruption, the `ReplicaSets` controller will notice that the desired state does not match the actual state, and a new pod will be created.

Deployments offer:

- High availability of your application (pods) by creating a `ReplicaSet`
- (Auto)scaling of pods
- Multiple strategies to deploy your application
- The possibility to rollback to an earlier revision of your deployment

Let's now create our Deployment. A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive.

❓ Create a configuration file for the deployment - `deployment.yaml` - and copy below content into it.

```yaml
#deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: fastapi-deployment

spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fastapi

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fastapi
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fastapi-container
          image: app:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000 # Same as service target port
```

In the first part of the configuration, we specify that the configuration we are applying is for a Deployment resource that we call `fastapi-deployment`.

In the spec, we specify the number of replicas, here 4.
It means that we will always have 4 pods running our application.
This pods will each run a container app that we have build previously and renamed `fastapi-container` here.

We then specify the port exposed in the container, here 8000 (as per Service's target port).

By Default, a Deployment will always try to pull the image from a remote registry. If you want to use a local image to build a container in the pods, you need to specify the `imagePullPolicy` to `Never`.

💡 You might get a warning that resource limits haven't been defined, that's ok for the moment.

Run the below command to run the deployment 👇

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

You should see `deployment.apps/fastapi-deployment created`

Let's inspect our 4 pods created 👇

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see 4 pods running:

```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fastapi-deployment-746c85b46f-2sdp2   1/1     Running   0          26s
fastapi-deployment-746c85b46f-dqcxs   1/1     Running   0          26s
fastapi-deployment-746c85b46f-h5vls   1/1     Running   0          26s
fastapi-deployment-746c85b46f-rgm82   1/1     Running   0          26s
```

<br>

# 6️⃣ Forwarding our service 🔗

To see the app running we need one last thing: to forward to port from the cluster to our VM!

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/fastapi-service 9000:5000
```

This command will forward the service port we defined in `service.yaml` (port 5000) to port 9000 on the localhost of your VM.

If you forward port 9000 to your host machine (MacBook, Windows...) and you should be able to access your running service!

<br>

# 7️⃣ Using Minikube dashboard 🖼️

Minikube has an excellent UI interface to manage and visualize your clusters!
You can use it to :

- Get an overview of applications running on the K8s cluster
- Deploy containerized applications to a K8s cluster
- Debug your containerized application
- Manage cluster resources and create or change individual resources

To launch the Minikube dashboard, let's open a new terminal and run:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

Then follow the address it gives and open it in your local browser! (with ssh-port-forwarding from your VM..)

<br>

# 8️⃣ Stopping Minikube 🛑

To delete your local cluster 👇

```bash
minikube delete
```

To stop Minikube 👇

```bash
minikube stop
```

<br>

# 🏁 Finishing up

Well done! 🙌 You've created a service using Kubernetes! In the next challenge we'll create a more detailed Kubernetes deployment of the Streamlit app we created in the previous unit.

🧪 Test all your code with:

```bash
make test
